            Anything happens in that five minutes, then I'm yours, no matter what. I wrote you everyday for a year. I don't sit in while you're running it down. When you breathe, you inhale and you exhale, but every single time that you do that you're a little bit different then the one before. All my characters are me.

            I wrote you 365 letters. If ever I try to predict, I'm sure I will be instantly humbled. And I just turn up the parts of myself that are them and turn down the parts that aren't. Do you understand? There would be no cuts, real people in there, real tellers.

            You get a new one. If I drive for you, you get your money. I get sick of myself, so I can imagine how everyone else feels. I hear about actors who become the role and I think 'I wonder what that feels like'. We're always changing.

            The pictures which will be accompanying this interview are basically of me in tight wet T-shirts and tiny leather jackets going around in the rain and pretending that I'm a lot cooler than I am. I fantasized about robbing banks for a long time, ever since I was a kid. Then, telling Derek Cianfrance that I'd ever I could rob a bank I'd do it on my motorcycle, and he said 'That's weird, I just wrote a script about that'. You tell me where we start, where we're going, where we're going afterwards. Not to discriminate against budgets, I feel that independent films tend to ask more questions and don't pretend to know as much as the bigger films, which tend to think they know everything.

            And its important to know that there are some changes you can't control and that there are others you can. Anything happens a minute either side of that, and you're on your own. Anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours. I don't carry a gun. Because for me, they're all me.
